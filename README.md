# 7z-build-nsis
7-zip build script with nsis script decompiling using ms visual studio

This build can unpack nsis script, eg. `[NSIS].nsi` or `[LICENSE].txt` from nsis installer.
This feature is disable in official versions since `15.05`,
after which official versions are only able to unpack files from installer.

Notice: Only executables depending on `7z.dll` can unpack nsis packages,
`7zcl`, `7za`, `7zr` would not unpack nsis package, like official ones.
